# Statistical-Relational-Learning
Given a particularMarkov network, we compute the partition function from the given potentials
available and then generate samples using 2 types of sampling method from the given
distribution. Later we perform a parameter and structure learning on one of the samples and
finally make inference both on the initial structure and learned structure. In this project the
termmarkov network , markov random field or MRF will be used interchangeably.
Given a network of 12 nodes and 18 edges, where the nodes are the random variables and
the edges signifies some sort of relationship unlike Bayesian network that strictly defines
dependencies. Since we do not have such variable dependencies or parent /child nodes, the
definition of functions over the variables are represented as cliques.
